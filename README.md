Data Cache
MIPS Simulator: Data Cache
Project 5 – CS 3339 – Fall 2022
PROBLEM STATEMENT
In this project, I will further enhance my simulator to model pipeline stalls due to memory latency, and I will simulate a data cache to study the performance impact of caching. I will begin with a copy of my Project 4.
